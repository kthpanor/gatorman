# Pushing the limits

Gator has the stated goal to be *science-enabling*. Behind this term there are a multitude of software requirements that we find important and strive against, including:

- accurate description of electronically excited states that show a more diffuse character than the ground state

- stable and reliable convergence of iterative equation solvers also with use of diffuse basis functions

- time-efficient prototyping of novel scientific approaches

- transparent exposure of data structures to enable in-depth analyses for standard users

- flexible ways to interact with other components of the simulation (such as molecular dynamics, parameterizing the embedding, and data visualization)

For the most parts, Gator implements few schemes to improve the formal scaling of the calculation but rather focus to implement the general and stable algorithms efficiently for HPC cluster computing. 

## Gator research highlights
A short summary and a figure from articles using Gator and which pushes the program capabilities in one direction or another.
