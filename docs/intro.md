## Ab initio quantum chemistry software for molecular properties

Gator {cite}`gator` is a Python-based open source quantum chemistry software developed for the calculation of molecular properties and simulation of a variety of spectroscopies.

Gator features interactive program access through Jupyter notebooks as well as large-scale calculations in contemporary high-performance computing (HPC) environments. A comprehensive presentation of the former desktop aspect is provided in the [eChem](https://kthpanor.github.io/echem) book and this manual will focus on the latter HPC aspect.

Gator is interlocked with the [VeloxChem](https://veloxchem.org) program where the latter serves as a provider of integrals and Hartreeâ€“Fock reference states.

**Key capabilities**

- Hierarchy of ADC methods for excited states
- Optical and X-ray absorption
- Excited state gradients
- Electronic circular dichroism (ECD)
- Polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients
- Complex polarization propagator (CPP)
